CodeAlpha Internship — Task 2

Unemployment Analysis in India using Python

Objective

Analyze unemployment data in India to understand:

Regional unemployment variation

Monthly/Yearly trends

The impact of COVID-19 (2020–2021) on unemployment rates

Dataset Information
File Used: Unemployment in India

Column Name	Description

State	Indian state / region

Date	                                    Data recording date

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)	         Percentage of unemployed individuals
Estimated Employed	                     Estimated number of employed people
Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)	Workforce participation percentage

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Performed

Converted Date → datetime

Removed invalid/missing unemployment records

Renamed columns for consistency

Filtered only required features

Analysis Performed (EDA)
Trend analysis by state
Year-wise unemployment shift
COVID-19 period vs Pre-COVID comparison
Correlation analysis between key parameters

Visualizations Included

✔ State-wise unemployment rate — Line Chart

✔ Regional comparison — Bar Chart

✔ COVID impact (pre vs during) — Box Plot

✔ National monthly unemployment trend — Time Series Plot

✔ Labour Participation vs Unemployment — Correlation Heatmap

Final Insights & Recommendations
Massive spike in unemployment during early COVID-19 lockdowns.

Some states consistently show higher unemployment — indicating structural issues.

Moderate negative correlation between unemployment rate & labour participation — jobs drop ⇒ people stop seeking work.

Recommended:
Region-specific job creation programs

Upskilling and industry-aligned training

Continuous monitoring post-pandemic
